                    <b>Infinitely Large Sequence:</b>
                    
                    <p>
                        A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is called infinitely large if $ \forall K \in \mathbb{R}$ $\exists n_{k} \in
                        \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n|>K$ $\forall n\geq n_k$.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        <b>Understanding What this means:</b>
                        This means you have a sequence and you are going for larger and larger terms for example you have a
                        sequence $\{a_n\}$ now, let's say you choose $2024 \in \mathbb{R}$ then as the sequence is getting
                        larger and larger after a certain time you must find a term $a_N$ such that $a_N>2024.$ <br>
                        Now, it may be two sided or one sided infinity as we go along the sequence and that is to say the
                        sequence can either go to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ or both simultaneosly. <br>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        <b>Why we need this?</b>
                        You may wonder that wtf? We can simply say:
                        $$\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=\infty$$
                        But then why this kid of gargons?<br>
                        The answer is tricky but simple concept of analysis that you must understand. <br>
                        The reason is how you know what is infinity? This is not a number right! Do you know what number is
                        infinity? Then how can you invoke it in mathematics? You cann't do any mathematical operations with
                        it. Then you can't techmically write some real number $x=\infty$. This is wrong. That's why we need
                        to bring the actual meaning of $\infty$ which is so large that we can't bound it by any real number
                        say $K$. That's why this is said that $\nexists K \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\infty \leq K$ or
                        $\forall K \in \mathbb{R}$, $K>\infty$.
